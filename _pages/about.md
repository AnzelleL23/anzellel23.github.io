## About Me

Hello, my name is Anzelle and I am a first year Computer Science PhD student at the National University of Singapore (NUS), School of Computing (SoC). I am also affiliated with the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A\*STAR), Centre for Frontier AI Research (CFAR). My current research interests are primarily in machine learning theory and optimization. I am jointly supervised by [Dr Atsushi Nitanda](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/cfar/about-cfar/our-team/dr-atsushi-nitanda) from A\*STAR CFAR and [Dr Kenji Kawaguchi](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/kenji/) from NUS SoC.

I graduated with a BSc in Data Science, with a second major in Economics, (also) from NUS. For my undergraduate thesis, I studied the effects of landscape modification and natural gradients on adaptive learning rate optimizers under the supervision of [Dr Michael Choi](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/faculty/michael-choi/).

Outside of academia, I enjoy going to the gym and scuba diving.
